# OpenQL Framework #

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/openql/badge/?version=latest)](https://openql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/imranashraf/travis-openql.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/imranashraf/travis-openql)

OpenQL is a framework for high-level quantum programming in C++/Python. The framework provides a compiler for compiling and optimizing quantum code. The compiler produces the intermediate quantum assembly language and the compiled micro-code for various target platforms. While the microcode is platform-specific, the quantum assembly code (qasm) is hardware-agnostic and can be simulated on the QX simulator. For detailed documentation see [here](https://openql.readthedocs.io).

## Supported Patforms

* Linux
* Windows
* OSX

## Installation

OpenQL can be installed in a number of ways, See [Installation](https://openql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for details.

## Usage
