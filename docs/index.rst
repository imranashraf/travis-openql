Welcome to OpenQL's documentation!
==================================

OpenQL is a framework for high-level quantum programming in C++/Python.
The framework provides a compiler for compiling and optimizing quantum code.
The compiler produces quantum assembly and instruction-level code for various target platforms.
While the instruction-level code is platform-specific, the quantum assembly code (QASM) is hardware-agnostic and can be simulated on one of the simulators.
